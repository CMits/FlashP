"""
Common types for FLASH-M **Light** schemas (Medical edition).

Light differs from the full pipeline (see ``../LEXICON.md`` for the full legend):

  * **Short field keys** via Pydantic aliases. Every slim model sets
    ``populate_by_name=True``, so BOTH the short alias (``m``) and the readable
    Python name (``gene_modifiers``) are accepted on input. Dump with
    ``model_dump(by_alias=True)`` to emit the short form.
  * **Short enum VALUES** (``NodeType.GENE == "G"``, ``NodeType.DRUG == "D"``,
    ``Direction.INCREASED == "up"``), but ``LexEnum._missing_`` also accepts the
    long/readable form ("GENE", "DRUG", "increased") so an agent that emits the
    readable value still validates.
  * **Provenance is a single ``doi`` string** (alias ``d``); the fat
    ``EvidenceEntry`` object is gone from the Light data files.

Medical edition deltas vs plant Light:
  * ``NodeType`` adds ``DRUG`` (short ``"D"``) for therapeutic agents.
  * ``PerturbationType`` carries the medical drug-response vocabulary (kept for
    reference/import-compat; ``pt`` is a free string in the slim schemas, with
    preferred short codes documented in ``../LEXICON.md``).

The legacy enums/models (``PerturbationType``, ``EdgeEffect``, ``Confidence``,
``Verification``, ``EvidenceEntry``) are kept defined for import-compatibility with
the rest of the package but are **not** used by the slim Light schemas.
