# FLASH-P Light — Abbreviation Lexicon

Single source of truth for the short keys / enum codes used in the **Light** JSON (and
TOON) files. Schemas accept BOTH the short and the long form on input
(`populate_by_name=True` for keys; `LexEnum._missing_` for enum values), but the Light
files are written in the **short** form. `metadata` and `parameters` blocks keep readable
keys (they appear once per file).

## Field keys (record-level)

| short | full | used in |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | test_id | perturbation, reconciled, results |
| `g` | gene | perturbation, reconciled, results |
| `pt` | perturbation_type | perturbation, reconciled, results |
| `ed` | expected_direction | perturbation, reconciled, results |
| `pd` | predicted_direction | results |
| `ng` | network_gene | reconciled |
| `m` | gene_modifiers | reconciled |
| `exo` | exogenous_supply | reconciled |
| `cb` | comparison_baseline | reconciled, results |
| `rt` | reconciliation_type | reconciled |
| `eid` | edge_id | curated_edges, network |
| `s` | source | curated_edges, network |
| `t` | target | curated_edges, network |
| `x` | sign | curated_edges, network |
| `d` | doi | all (single provenance field) |
| `sp` | species | perturbation |
| `n` | node | equations, annotations |
| `ty` | type | network nodes, equations, annotations |
| `fn` | full_name | network nodes, annotations |
| `src` | is_source | network nodes, equations, annotations |
| `desc` | description | annotations |
| `a` | activators | equations |
| `inh` | inhibitors | equations |
| `f` | formula | equations |

Top-level keys (`metadata`, `nodes`, `edges`, `papers`, `perturbations`, `parameters`,
`annotations`, `equations`) stay readable.

| `PC` | PROTEIN_COMPLEX |
| `R` | REGULATORY_RNA |
| `P` | PHENOTYPE |
| `PR` | PROCESS |
| `D` | DRUG |

**expected_direction / predicted_direction (`ed`/`pd`)**

| short | full |
|---|---|
| `up` | increased |

**perturbation_type (`pt`)** — free string; preferred short codes:

| short | full |
|---|---|
| `ko` | knockout |
| `kd` | knockdown |
| `oe` | overexpression |
| `dko` | double_knockout |
| `tko` | triple_knockout |

| `lof` | loss_of_function |
| `rsc` | rescue |
| `trt` | treatment |
| `dm` | double_mutant |
| `cmb` | combined |
| `ep` | epistasis |

**Medical drug-response `pt` codes** (also free string; long form accepted):

| short | full |
|---|---|
| `dt` | drug_treatment |
| `ki` | kinase_inhibitor_treatment |
| `ab` | antibody_treatment |
| `lig` | ligand_stimulation |
| `prot` | PROTAC_degradation / PROTAC_treatment |
| `ko+d` | knockout_plus_drug |
| `kd+d` | knockdown_plus_drug |
| `oe+d` | overexpression_plus_drug |
| `rm+d` | resistance_mutation_plus_drug (rescue should FAIL — e.g. EGFR T790M + erlotinib) |
| `sm+d` | sensitizing_mutation_plus_drug (rescue succeeds — e.g. EGFR L858R + erlotinib) |
| `combo` | combination_therapy |
| `vc` | vehicle_control |

## Derived (not stored)

| field | how it's recovered |
|---|---|
| `effect` | from `sign` (`1`→activation, `-1`→inhibition) |
| `in_model` (curated edge) | edge appears in `network.json` (match source/target/sign) |
| node degrees (in/out/total, n_activators/n_inhibitors) | recomputed from edges |
| `phenotype_node` (per test) | from `metadata.phenotype_node` |
| bibliography (title/authors/year/journal) | not kept — Light keeps `doi` only |
