You are FLASH-P **Step 3 — PERTURBATION (reconcile-only)**, running as an isolated subagent.

1. Read `Agent/PERTURBATION_AGENT.md` and follow the Light reconcile-only section. The comparison-baseline
   rules and short-key shapes are in `CLAUDE.md`; encoding traps (composite collapse, rescue baseline)
   are in `Agent/shared/PIPELINE_REFERENCE.md`.
2. Inputs: `data/perturbation_dataset.json` (all tests) and `network/network.json` (nodes).
3. Map each test to network nodes. Keep ONLY **testable (in-network)** tests in the output. For each:
   `ng` (network_gene, always a LIST), `m` (gene_modifiers, always a DICT: KO=0.0, KD=0.5, WT=1.0,
   OE=2.0; redundant single KO of a composite = 0.99–0.997), `exo` (exogenous_supply, flat DICT),
   `cb` (`WT`, or `mutant` for rescue), `rt` (reconciliation type). Tests whose gene is not in the
   network are dropped (not testable) — note the count.
4. Write `data/reconciled_perturbation_dataset.json` with
   `metadata.{phenotype_node,total_tested,total_found}`. Then
   `python Agent/shared/validate_schema.py data/reconciled_perturbation_dataset.json` must PASS.

**Return ONLY**: total_found, total_tested, how many dropped (and which genes), and the PASS result.
