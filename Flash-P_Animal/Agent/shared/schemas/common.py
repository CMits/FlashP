"""
Common types for FLASH-P **Light** schemas (Animal / Cattle edition).

Light differs from the full pipeline (see ``../LEXICON.md`` for the full legend):

  * **Short field keys** via Pydantic aliases. Every slim model sets
    ``populate_by_name=True``, so BOTH the short alias (``m``) and the readable
    Python name (``gene_modifiers``) are accepted on input. Dump with
    ``model_dump(by_alias=True)`` to emit the short form.
  * **Short enum VALUES** (``NodeType.GENE == "G"``, ``Direction.INCREASED == "up"``),
    but ``LexEnum._missing_`` also accepts the long/readable form ("GENE",
    "increased") so an agent that emits the readable value still validates.
  * **Provenance is a single ``doi`` string** (alias ``d``); the fat
    ``EvidenceEntry`` object is gone from the Light data files.

Animal edition: standard 8 node types (no DRUG). ``PerturbationType`` carries the
livestock drug/treatment vocabulary (kept for reference/import-compat; ``pt`` is a
free string in the slim schemas, with preferred short codes in ``../LEXICON.md``).

The legacy enums/models (``PerturbationType``, ``EdgeEffect``, ``Confidence``,
``Verification``, ``EvidenceEntry``) are kept defined for import-compatibility with
the rest of the package but are **not** used by the slim Light schemas.
